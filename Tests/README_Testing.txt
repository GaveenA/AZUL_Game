The tests contain the follwing types of files 

1. The text file ending in 'testName_Input.txt' 
    - This file contains the sequence of commands which load the relevant save file - 'testName'
    into the game then proceed to execute several 'turn' operations and finally save the game as "testName.out"
    

2. The load file 'testName'
        - This is the save file which is loaded by the user input text file 'testName_Input.txt' 
        This contains the save file which is required to run the test by executing the User Commands in the text file  ending in '_Input.txt' 

3. The file with format 'testName_Expected.out'
    - This is the expected save file format AFTER having executed the commands in 'testName_Input.txt'
    We compare this file to the save file 'testName.out' which is generated after testName_Input.txt commands are run.

4. The example save file 'testName.out'
    - An example copy of the testName.out file has been provied for ease of testing.
    To simplify the process you simply have to compare testName.out and testName_Expected.out using the 'diff' command 
    :: << diff testName.out testName_Expected.out >>

    However this testName.out file can be regenerated by executing the following commands on terminal
    1: Open a terminal in the correct directory containing project .cpp files 
    2: type 'make' command and click enter - This compliles the code and creates the executable 'assignnmen2'
    3: type into terminal:   ./assignnmen2 < testName_Input.txt 
    4: a new 'testName.out' will appear and overwrite the old one




Steps to Execute Test:

    1: compile the code by executing 'make' command in the terminal (assuming terminal opened in the correct directory which contains all of the project .cpp files)
    2: This compliles the code and creates the executable 'assignnmen2'
    3: type into terminal::   ./assignnmen2 < testName_Input.txt 
    4: The commands in the input file will then execute and a "testName.out" file will appear in the directory (any previous testName.out file will be overwritten)
    5: execute in terminal: diff testName.out testName_Expected.out 
    6: This command will compare the files "testName.out" and the "testName_Expected.out" (already provided) and will not raise any errors if they are identical
